Text: I am requesting the access to the following repositoryes "linkrepository1" "linkrepository2" "linkrepository3". Thanks

# Why i need to complete the following procedure
Some repositoryes of my works will be public but others like the website source code need to be private to prevent abuse

# If some users access to your private repositoryes requesting access, they download your projects and reupload to a new repository or they make a fork of your private repositoryes what will happen?
Just don't do it please
